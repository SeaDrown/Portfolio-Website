            <p>
                This project has been coded in Python and in Java seperately, but since they are the same concepts, I
                consider them one project.
                It was designed to be a simple project, in order to get myself accustomed to the languages.
                The project utilized an object oriented approach to handling things like the stack of cards and the
                player and dealer themselves.
