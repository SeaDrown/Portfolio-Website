        </br>

        <p class="normal_text">
            Here lies my personal experiences in various fields of study and industries.

        <h4 class="normal_text">Roblox</h4>

        <p class="normal_text">
            My first real introduction to anything technology related was through Roblox's Luau language, a sandboxed
            version of Lua 5.1.
            I loved playing Roblox, and had played it for years, and so manking my own game was a dream come true!
            I was 13 and easily distracted, so I created many different projects, bouncing from one game to another
            plenty.
            I coded up poor quality monolithic game systems, but regardless I was (and still am) very proud of the
            effort and the results.
            Seeing something that I spent hours planning and debugging made everything very much worth the struggle of
            beginner coding, and taught me many key principles in programming, such as modular code and OOP.

        <h4 class="normal_text">Early education</h4>

        <p class="normal_text">
            As well as Roblox, I also took computer science classes in highschool and college.
            Specifically, I took GCSE Computer Science and A-Level Computer Science.
            I achieved a grade 9 in GCSE Computer Science, which I was very pleased with.
            However, I had not been strict with my studies, and relied purely on my intuition for my GCSE period.
            My other grades were similarly high, and so transitioning from highschool to college was a significant
            personal and academic challenge.
            By the time I had to take my A-Level exams, I had fallen behind significantly.
            I achieved a C in A-Level Computer Science.
            This was a significant drop from the 9 I had achieved only 2 years prior.
            My ego and some mental issues prevented me from achieving what I should have achieved.
            Despite this, I did not hate or scold myself; I understood that I had potential that was yet to be realised,
            and so I saw this as a minor roadbump in the greater scheme of things.
            I still felt very disappointed by the low grade, but I have always understood that all I need is a plan.
            In college, I failed to plan, and so I planned to fail.
            This is a lesson I only truly learned in my 2nd year of university, but one that is now a core part of how I
            operate.
