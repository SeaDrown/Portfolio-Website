        <h1 class="normal_text">About me</h1>

        </br>

        <p class="normal_text">
            Here lie my personal experiences in various fields of study and industries.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3 class="normal_text">Technology</h3>

        <br />

        <h4 class="normal_text">Roblox</h4>
        <p class="normal_text">
            My first real introduction to anything technology related was through Roblox's Luau language, a sandboxed
            version of Lua 5.1.
            I loved playing Roblox, and had played it for years, and so manking my own game was a dream come true!
            I was 13 and easily distracted, so I created many different projects, bouncing from one game to another
            plenty.
            I coded up poor quality monolithic game systems, but regardless I was (and still am) very proud of the
            effort and the results.
            Seeing something that I spent hours planning and debugging made everything very much worth the struggle of
            beginner coding, and taught me many key principles in programming, such as modular code and OOP.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h4 class="normal_text">Early education</h4>
        <p class="normal_text">
            As well as Roblox, I also took computer science classes in highschool and college.
            Specifically, I took GCSE Computer Science and A-Level Computer Science.
            I achieved a grade 9 in GCSE Computer Science, which I was very pleased with.
            However, I had not been strict with my studies, and relied purely on my intuition for my GCSE period.
            My other grades were similarly high, and so transitioning from highschool to college was a significant
            personal and academic challenge.
            By the time I had to take my A-Level exams, I had fallen behind significantly.
            I achieved a C in A-Level Computer Science.
            This was a significant drop from the 9 I had achieved only 2 years prior.
            My ego and some mental issues prevented me from achieving what I should have achieved.
            Despite this, I did not hate or scold myself; I understood that I had potential that was yet to be realised,
            and so I saw this as a minor roadbump in the greater scheme of things.
            I still felt very disappointed by the low grade, but I have always understood that all I need is a plan.
            In college, I failed to plan, and so I planned to fail.
            This is a lesson I only truly learned in my 2nd year of university, but one that is now a core part of how I
            operate.

        <br />

        <h4 class="normal_text">Hackathons</h4>
        <p class="normal_text">
            During my enrollment in university, I have attended a few hackathons, and plan to attend many more.
            I am highly grateful that I have had the opportunity to participate in hackathons, between my busy schedule
            and other extra-curricular obligations.
            I think that hackathons are the best way for anyone to break into technology, especially if one already has
            a background in programming.
            With that being said, I have (so far) only won one hackathon: University of Glasgow's Do You Have the GUTS?

            <br />
            <br />

            This hackathon was amazing, and I throroughly enjoyed it. My and my teammates worked on a challenging
            website designed to help clients make informed desicions about which guitar they would like to buy, from
            GuitarGuitar's store.
            By the time the website was developed, it was sophisticated and feature-packed.
            This made it difficult for me to understand, as I had little experience with HTML, CSS or JS prior.

            <br />
            <br />
        </p>

        <p class="normal_text">This website included:</p>
        <ul class="normal_text" , style="font-weight: 700;">
            <li>Contextual AI chatbot</li>
            <li>Guitar comparison table</li>
            <li>Tinder-style guitar choosing</li>
            <li>Personality quiz</li>
        </ul>


        <br />

        <p class="normal_text">
            This variety of features was a splash of cold water into the reality of web development, and I learned so
            much in the 2 days the hackathon was active for.
            From implementing the guitar comparisons using a web API to fetch data, to utilising OpenAI secret keys in
            order to make the chat possible, this website taught me that I don't know what I don't know.
            I am very grateful for this, as it showed me that if I want to succeed in any space in technology, I really
            need to be more knowledgable.
            Solving a daily leetcode from time to time and gawking over my sub-optimal solutions to Project Euler
            problems simply would not be enough.
            This inspired me to create this website, in order to hone my own web development skills, and invest in my
            toolkit for the
            future.

        <p class="normal_text">
            In the end, our team recieved the 1st place prize for GuitarGuitar's challenge.
            However, I recieved far more than a certificate and some bragging rights; I recieved experience.
            Experience collaborating with Git, experience creating a project under time restraints, experience using an AI code companion efficiently, not just to do but to learn too.
            These experiences were worth far more than any certificate or praise I recieved from the hackathon.
